When you use the curly braces or {} operators, they serve as place-holders for the variables you would like to store inside a string. In order to pass variables to a string you must call upon the format() method.

One benefit of using the format() method is that you do not have to convert integers into a string before concatenating the data. It will do that automatically for you. This is one reason why it is the preferred operator method.

Fname = “John”
Lname = “Doe”
Age = “24”


print “{} {} is {} years old.“ format(fname, lname, age)
