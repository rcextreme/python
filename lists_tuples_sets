##### Lists
# list are like arrays.  you can add elements
# It can have any number of items
###### Tuples
# tuples is a fixed size list. say of 3 or 4 elements. you can't add/subtract elements once created
###### set
# A set is a list where each item is is unique.
# Also sets cannot contain mutable elements like list, set or dictionaries


# empty list
my_list = []

# list of integers
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

# list with mixed datatypes
my_list = [1, "Hello", 3.4]

>>> type(my_list)
<type 'list'>

# an empty tuple
a=()
type(a)
<type 'tuple'>

my_tuple = 3, 4.6, "dog"
print my_tuple
(3, 4.6, 'dog')
a, b, c = my_tuple
print a
3

# an empy set
a=set()
type(a)
<type 'set'>

my_set = {1, 2, 3}
print(my_set)
set([1, 2, 3])

my_set={1,2,3}
my_set.add(4)
print my_set
set([1, 2, 3, 4])
